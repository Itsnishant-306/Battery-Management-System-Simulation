# Battery Management System (BMS) Simulation

## Project Overview

This project simulates a Battery Management System for lithium-ion battery packs, focusing on monitoring, safety, optimization, and data analysis. The simulation models real-world battery behavior including thermal effects, cell aging, and state-of-charge estimation, while implementing safety protocols and efficiency measures.

## Project Goals

1. Create a realistic simulation of battery cell behavior and pack configurations
2. Implement comprehensive monitoring and safety protocols
3. Design optimization algorithms for charging and discharging
4. Develop data collection, analysis, and visualization capabilities
5. Document standard operating procedures and safety guidelines

## System Architecture

The BMS simulation is structured into three main components:

1. **BatteryCell**: Models individual lithium-ion cells with realistic physical properties
